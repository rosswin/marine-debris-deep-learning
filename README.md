## Study Abstract
Marine debris is a global crisis that negatively affects human health and safety, wildlife, and coastal economies. Geospatial technology has been deployed to map, measure, and model the sources, pathways, and eventual sinks of marine debris, however data are still scarce due to the high cost of conducting fieldwork or manually labeling debris in remote sensing images. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning have brought rapid automation of tedious tasks to new domains, such as marine debris identification in aerial imagery. This study evaluates deep learning-based object detection to automatically detect, localize, and classify stranded marine debris along 1,200 km of the diverse Hawaiian coastline. Two leading object detection models were tested: Faster RCNN with Inception-ResNet-v2 (FR-IR) and SSD with MobileNetV2 (SS-MN). These two models offer a tradeoff between detection speed and identification precision, with one model performing 5xâ€™s as quickly. The results show that the model with higher computational cost, FR-IR, can detect and classify mega-debris (marine debris larger than 10cm) with a mean average precision (mAP) of 57.4%. The speedier model, SS-MN, detects and classifies mega-debris with an mAP of 36.1%. When viewed in detail the results of our object detection and deep learning classifiers show clear best practices for the advancement of deep learning for real-world management of shoreline stranded marine debris at the large, regional scale.

## Overview
- **1--installation** contains Docker installation files. Native environment is Ubuntu 16.04+. Untested elsewhere.
- **2--preprocessing** contains scripts to 1) retile GIS imagery and 2) reformat GIS annotations into training data for the Tensorflow Object Detection API (TFODAPI).
- **3--training** contains the .config files that control each object detection model's hyperparameters, data augmentation options, etc. Also contains a .pbtxt format map of class name to class numbers as required by TFODAPI. TFODAPI's model_main.py script is the main training routine and not included in this repository (see sources below).
- **4--evaluation** contains scripts to calculate per-class statistics and class confuision matricies. Additionally includes scripts for creating publication quality plots from our model outputs. High-level evaluation statistics such as COCO mAP are provided natively by TFODAPI through Tensorboard and do not require additional code.
